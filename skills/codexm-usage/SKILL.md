# codexm Usage

Use this skill when the user is asking how to use `codexm` as a tool, including account dashboard flows, share-bundle import/export, and `codexm run`. Do not use it for `codex-team` implementation, testing, release, or code review work.

## How to use

1. First identify the user's goal: inspect state, inspect current usage, compare accounts, add a new login, save or refresh the current login, switch accounts, open the account dashboard, export or import a share bundle, launch Desktop, run the CLI through the restart wrapper, enable or inspect the local proxy account, watch quota behavior, set up shell completion, or explain command behavior.
2. Prefer the shortest command that matches that goal.
3. If the user is unsure about current state, start with `codexm current` or `codexm list`; use `codexm doctor` when they are debugging runtime or Desktop consistency.
4. If the question is about Desktop behavior, explain the difference between `switch`, `launch`, `autoswitch`, and `watch` before giving commands.

## Route by task

- Command map: [references/commands.md](references/commands.md)
- Dashboard keymap and prompt behavior: [references/dashboard.md](references/dashboard.md)
- Proxy mode behavior: [references/proxy.md](references/proxy.md)
- Managed Desktop behavior: [references/managed-desktop.md](references/managed-desktop.md)

## Response Guidance

- When the user expects Desktop to switch accounts immediately, explain the difference between `switch` and `launch`.
- If the user mentions an in-progress managed Desktop thread, mention the default wait behavior and the `--force` trade-off.
- If the user asks for background auto-switching on managed Desktop or proxy flows, route them to `codexm autoswitch enable`; use `codexm watch` when they explicitly want the foreground quota monitor, and add `--no-auto-switch` only when they want observation without account changes.
- If the user asks for current usage, prefer `codexm current`; add `--refresh` only when they explicitly want the latest data.
- If the user is debugging mismatches between local auth, managed Desktop, and direct runtime reads, route them to `codexm doctor`.
- If the user wants to add another account without changing current auth, prefer `codexm add <name>`; use `--device-auth` for remote/headless machines and `--with-api-key` only when they explicitly want API-key auth.
- If a saved account already exists but its auth or refresh token is broken, route them to `codexm replace <name>` so the snapshot is overwritten in place.
- If the user wants to update the saved snapshot for the account already active in local auth, route them to `codexm update`.
- If the user asks how to compare accounts or understand why `switch --auto` picked one, prefer `codexm list --verbose`.
- If the user wants an interactive picker, filtering, import/export, delete, or Desktop launch in one place, route them to plain `codexm` in a TTY or `codexm tui [query]`.
- If the user wants to move a login to another trusted machine without re-login, route them to `codexm export`, `codexm inspect`, and `codexm import`, and mention that share bundles are plain auth snapshots for fully trusted recipients only.
- If the user wants a CLI workflow that survives account-triggered restarts, route them to `codexm run -- ...codexArgs`.
- If the user wants Codex or another OpenAI-compatible tool to use one stable local endpoint while `codexm` routes to saved upstream accounts internally, route them to `codexm proxy enable`, `codexm proxy status`, and later `codexm proxy disable`; mention that `codexm switch <name>` updates only the proxy's current upstream while proxy remains enabled and does not replace the synthetic proxy auth, autoswitch only moves that upstream after quota-exhaustion signals, proxy websocket turns and buffered REST requests can auto-replay once on quota exhaustion before user-visible or side-effectful output starts, both the dashboard and `codexm list` always show the aggregate `proxy` pool row even before proxy mode is enabled, the pool quota/ETA count non-protected eligible accounts with quota snapshots including exhausted ones, managed Desktop usage/account reads stay on the synthetic proxy account surface, `@` marks the configured current upstream while proxy stays enabled, and `Proxy last upstream: ...` / `Last upstream: ...` still describe the most recent real proxy hit when known.
- If a fresh quota read fails, explain that `codexm list` and the dashboard can fall back to that account's last good quota snapshot for up to 7 days and will mark the row as `[stale]`.
- If the user wants proxy behavior for one isolated run without writing sessions/auth/config into the live runtime, route them to `codexm run --proxy -- ...codexArgs`; explain that `codexm`-managed proxy entrypoints rewrite the transport URLs for both live Desktop/CLI flows and isolated proxy runs, so live Responses websocket turns as well as REST `/v1` traffic honor the local proxy, while unmanaged bare `codex` / Desktop launches are still outside that guarantee.
- If the user says the default proxy port is occupied, mention `CODEXM_PROXY_PORT=<port>` for a shared-daemon-wide override, and mention that `codexm proxy enable --port <port>` overrides the env var for that command.
- If the user asks for shell completion, route them to `codexm completion <zsh|bash>` and mention that the generated scripts complete commands, known subcommands, flags after `-` / `--`, and saved account names dynamically.
- When the user wants machine-readable output, include `--json` where supported.
- If the user wants raw command help only, answer with commands first and keep explanation short.
